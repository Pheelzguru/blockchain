                    <p id="text"><span style="color: gold;"><b>What Is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT)?</b></span>
                        Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic assets on a blockchain with unique identification
                        codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other.

                        Unlike cryptocurrencies, they cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. This differs from
                        fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies, which are identical to each other and, therefore, can
                        serve as a medium for commercial transactions.</p>
                    <P id="text"><span style="color: gold;"><b>KEY TAKEAWAYS</b></span> <br>
                        NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot
                        be replicated. <br>
                        NFTs can represent real-world items like artwork and real estate. <br>
                        "Tokenizing" these real-world tangible assets makes buying, selling, and trading them more
                        efficient while reducing the probability of fraud. <br>
                        NFTs can also function to represent individuals' identities, property rights, and more. <br>
                        Collectors have sought NFTs as their value initially soared, but has since moderated.</p>

                    <p id="text"><span style="color: gold;"><b>How Can I Buy NFTs?</b></span>
                        Many NFTs can only be purchased with Ether, so owning some of this cryptocurrency—and storing it in
                        a digital wallet—is usually the first step. You can then purchase NFTs via any of the online NFT
                        marketplaces, including OpenSea, Rarible, and SuperRare.</p>
                    

                        <p id="text"><span style="color: gold;"><b>Are NFTs Safe?</b></span>
                    Non-fungible tokens, which use blockchain technology just like cryptocurrency, are generally secure.
                    The distributed nature of blockchains makes NFTs difficult (although not impossible) to hack. One
                    security risk for NFTs is that you could lose access to your non-fungible token if the platform
                    hosting the NFT goes out of business.</p>

                    <p id="text"><span style="color: gold;"><b>What Does Non-Fungible Mean?</b></span>
                    Fungibility is an economics term that describes the interchangeability of certain goods. For
                    example, a barrel of oil is fungible (interchangeable/indistinguishable) from any other barrel of
                    oil. A dollar bill, likewise, is equal to any other dollar bill (or 4 quarters, etc.). Non-fungible
                    is to render such items unique or distinguishable. For instance, if you were to take a dollar bill
                    and have it drawn on and signed by a famous artist, it become unique - unlike all other dollar
                    bills, and perhaps worth more than its face value.</p>
