    <h2 id="head">Discord App</h2>

    <p id="text">Discord is a VoIP and instant messaging social platform. Users have the ability to communicate with voice calls,
    video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called "servers". A
    server is a collection of persistent chat rooms and voice channels which can be accessed via invite links.
    Discord is a free voice, video, and text chat app that's used by tens of millions of people ages 13+ to talk and
    hang out with their communities and friends. People use Discord daily to talk about many things, ranging from art
    projects and family trips to homework and mental health support.</p> <br> <br>

    <p id="text">An NFT Discord is used by NFT projects and brands as a gathering place for their community. NFT Discord servers are
    where you will find announcements, updates, and support surrounding an NFT project. These servers are generally free
    to join and even encouraged by the project and community members.</p> <br> <br>
