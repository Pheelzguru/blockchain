                    <h3 id="main">How security differs by blockchain types</h3>
                    <p id='text'>
                        Blockchain networks can differ in who can participate and who has access to the data. Networks
                        are typically labeled as either public or private, which describes who is allowed to
                        participate, and permissioned or permissionless, which describes how participants gain access to
                        the network.</p>

                        <h4  id="sub">Public and private blockchains</h4>
                        <p id='text'>Public blockchain networks typically allow anyone to join and for participants to remain
                        anonymous. A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and
                        achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well-known example of a public blockchain, and
                        it achieves consensus through "bitcoin mining." Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,”
                        try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the
                        transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of
                        network.</p>

                        <p id='text'>Private blockchains use identity to confirm membership and access privileges and typically only
                        permit known organizations to join. Together, the organizations form a private, members-only
                        "business network." A private blockchain in a permissioned network achieves consensus through a
                        process called "selective endorsement," where known users verify the transactions. Only members
                        with special access and permissions can maintain the transaction ledger. This network type
                        requires more identity and access controls.</p>

                        <p id='text'>When building a blockchain application, it’s critical to assess which type of network will best
                        suit your business goals. Private and permissioned networks can be tightly controlled and
                        preferable for compliance and regulatory reasons. However, public and permissionless networks
                        can achieve greater decentralization and distribution.</p>


                        <p id='text'>Public blockchains are public, and anyone can join them and validate transactions. <br>

                        Private blockchains are restricted and usually limited to business networks. A single entity, or
                        consortium, controls membership. <br>

                        Permissionless blockchains have no restrictions on processors. <br>

                        Permissioned blockchains are limited to a select set of users who are granted identities using
                        certificates.</p>              
                       
                    
                    <h3 id="main">How fraudsters attack blockchain technology</h3>
                    
                        <p class="lead" id="text">Hackers and fraudsters threaten blockchains in four primary ways: phishing, routing, Sybil and
                        51% attacks.</p>

                        <p id='text'>While blockchain technology produces a tamper-proof ledger of transactions, blockchain networks
                        are not immune to cyberattacks and fraud. Those with ill intent can manipulate known
                        vulnerabilities in blockchain infrastructure and have succeeded in various hacks and frauds over
                        the years. Here are a few examples:</p>
                        
                        <h4  id="sub">Phishing attacks</h4>

                        <p id='text'> Phishing is a scamming attempt to attain a user's credentials. Fraudsters send wallet key owners
                        emails designed to look as though they're coming from a legitimate source. The emails ask users
                        for their credentials using fake hyperlinks. Having access to a user's credentials and other
                        sensitive information can result in losses for the user and the blockchain network.</p>

                        <h4  id="sub">Routing attacks</h4>
                        <p id='text'>  Blockchains rely on real-time, large data transfers. Hackers can intercept data as it's
                        transferring to internet service providers. In a routing attack, blockchain participants
                        typically can't see the threat, so everything looks normal. However, behind the scenes,
                        fraudsters have extracted confidential data or currencies.</p>

                        <h4 id="sub">Sybil attacks</h4>
                        <p id='text'> In a Sybil attack, hackers create and use many false network identities to flood the network and
                        crash the system. Sybil refers to a famous book character diagnosed with a multiple identity
                        disorder.</p>

                        <h4  id="sub">51% attacks</h4>
                        <p id='text'>  Mining requires a vast amount of computing power, especially for large-scale public blockchains.
                        But if a miner, or a group of miners, could rally enough resources, they could attain more than
                        50% of a blockchain network's mining power. Having more than 50% of the power means having
                        control over the ledger and the ability to manipulate it.</p>

                        <p id='text'>  <span style="color: red;"><b>Note:</b></span> Private blockchains are not vulnerable to 51% attacks.

                        In today's digital world it is essential to take steps to ensure the security of both your
                        blockchain design and environment(by being cautious first). X-Force Red blockchain testing services can help you do just
                        that.</p>
