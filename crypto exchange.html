    <h1 id="head">CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGE</h1>
    <p id="text">A cryptocurrency exchange, or a digital currency exchange (DCE), is a business that allows customers to
        trade
        cryptocurrencies or digital currencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money or other digital
        currencies. Exchanges may accept credit card payments, wire transfers or other forms of payment in exchange for
        digital currencies or cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency exchange can be a market maker that typically takes the
        bidâ€“ask spreads as a transaction commission for is service or, as a matching platform, simply charges fees.</p>
    <p id="text">Some brokerages which also focus on other assets such as stocks, like Robinhood and eToro, let users
        purchase but not withdraw cryptocurrencies to cryptocurrency wallets. Dedicated cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and
        Coinbase do allow cryptocurrency withdrawals, however.The exchanges can send cryptocurrency to a user's personal
        cryptocurrency wallet. Some can convert digital currency
        balances into anonymous prepaid cards which can be used to withdraw funds from ATMs worldwide while other
        digital currencies are backed by real-world commodities such as gold.</p>

        <p id="text">The creators of digital currencies are often independent of the digital currency exchange that facilitate trading in
    the currency. In one type of system, digital currency providers (DCP) are businesses that keep and administer
    accounts for their customers, but generally do not issue digital currency to those customers directly.
    Customers buy or sell digital currency from digital currency exchanges, who transfer the digital currency into or
    out of the customer's DCP account. Some exchanges are subsidiaries of DCP, but many are legally independent
    businesses. The denomination of funds kept in DCP accounts may be of a real or fictitious currency.</p>

    <p id="text">A digital currency exchange can be a brick-and-mortar business or a strictly online business. As a brick-and-mortar
    business, it exchanges traditional payment methods and digital currencies. As an online business, it exchanges
    electronically transferred money and digital currencies.</p>

    <p id="text"> Often, the digital currency exchanges operate outside the Western countries to avoid regulation and prosecution.
    However, they do handle Western fiat currencies and maintain bank accounts in several countries to facilitate
    deposits in various national currencies.</p>

    <p id="text">Decentralized exchanges such as Etherdelta, IDEX and HADAX do not store users' funds on the exchange, but instead
    facilitate peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading. Decentralized exchanges are resistant to security problems that
    affect other exchanges, but as of mid 2018 suffer from low trading volumes.</p>

    <p id="text">In early 2018, Bloomberg News reported the largest cryptocurrency exchanges based on the volume and estimated
    revenues data collected by CoinMarketCap. Similar statistics was reported on Statista in a survey by Encrybit to
    understand cryptocurrency exchange problems. According to the survey, the top three cryptocurrency exchanges are
    Binance, Huobi, and OKEX. Other data points in the survey included the problems that cryptocurrency traders
    experience with cryptocurrency exchanges and the expectation of traders. Security and high trading fees are the top
    concerns. The exchanges are all fairly new and privately held. Several do not report basic information such
    as the names of the owners, financial data, or even the location of the business. And these are the top exchange platforms</p>
