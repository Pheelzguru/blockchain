   <p id="text">In blockchain storage, files are first broken apart in a process called sharding. Each shard is copied to prevent
    loss of data should an error occur during transmission. The files are also encrypted with a private key that makes
    it impossible for it to be viewed by other nodes in the network. <br>

    Blockchain-enabled smart contracts create self-executing transactions that automatically capture assets to satisfy
    obligations. They are a form of asset partitioning. Some scholars compare smart contracts to self-help, analogous to
    security interests. Others describe the asset-shielding function of smart contracts, analogous to entity law.

    Each new block connects to all the blocks before it in a cryptographic chain in such a way that it's nearly
    impossible to tamper with. All transactions within the blocks are validated and agreed upon by a consensus
    mechanism, ensuring that each transaction is true and correct.</p>

    <p id="text">Nevertheless, P2P transaction (Person to Person transaction) is also one major trusted way of Trading, this is 
        where you carry out your trading activities with someone trusted worthy and reliable
